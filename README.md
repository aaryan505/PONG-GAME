# Pong Game ðŸŽ®
This project is a simple implementation of the classic Pong game using Python's turtle graphics library. The game is designed for two players, with each player controlling a paddle to bounce the ball back and forth. The objective is to score points by making the opponent miss the ball.

# Features
1)Two-player gameplay with separate controls for each paddle.
2)Real-time collision detection with the paddles and screen edges.
3)Scorekeeping for both players.
4)Simple and intuitive controls.
# How to Play
# Controls
# Right Paddle (Player 1):
Move Up: Up Arrow
Move Down: Down Arrow
# Left Paddle (Player 2):
Move Up: W
Move Down: S
# Objective
1)Players must use their paddles to hit the ball back and forth.
2)If a player misses the ball, the opponent scores a point.
3)The game continues indefinitely, keeping track of each player's score.
# Code Overview
# Main Components
1)Paddle Class: Handles the creation and movement of the paddles.
2)Ball Class: Manages the movement of the ball and its collisions with the paddles and walls.
3)Scoreboard Class: Keeps track of and displays the score.
# Game Loop
The game loop runs continuously, updating the screen and checking for collisions. It also handles the scoring by detecting when the ball passes a paddle.

# Dependencies
turtle: This standard Python library is used for creating the game's graphics and handling user input.
# Setup and Run
